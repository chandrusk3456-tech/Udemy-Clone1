Udemy Clone is a front-end web project built using HTML5 and CSS3, inspired by the layout and design of the popular online learning platform Udemy.
This project showcases a responsive user interface with a structured course section, navigational header, and styled components to replicate key visual elements of an e-learning site.
It helped me strengthen my skills in semantic HTML, CSS layout techniques, and responsive design principles.
